# Player Component

## Overview
The player component represents a player in the game, handling their movement, physics interactions, and visual representation.

## Core Features
- 3D model rendering
- Physics-based movement
- Collision detection
- Animation system
- Network synchronization

## Technical Details
- Uses Three.js for 3D rendering
- Implements Cannon.js for physics
- Handles WebSocket communication for position updates
- Manages player state and animations

## Key Components
1. **Visual Model**
   - 3D character model
   - Texture and material management
   - Animation system

2. **Physics Body**
   - Rigid body physics
   - Collision detection
   - Movement constraints

3. **Network Sync**
   - Position interpolation
   - State synchronization
   - Lag compensation
